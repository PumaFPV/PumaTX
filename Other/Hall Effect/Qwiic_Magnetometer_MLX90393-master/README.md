The SparkFun MLX90393 Magnetometer Breakout is a triple-axis magnetic sensor board capable of sensing very small fields (like the Earthâ€™s magnetic field), while still behaving as one would expect during saturation in larger fields (like a nearby magnet). The MLX90393 breakout can be used as a compass sensor but also works well as a non-contact controller, a flow meter with a magnetic impeller, or a linear actuator position sensor. To make it even easier to to get your readings, all communication is enacted exclusively via I2C, utilizing our handy Qwiic system. However, we still have broken out 0.1"-spaced pins in case you prefer to use a breadboard.
