==32 Channel Receiver Mod==

I started my project base on the following product:

[http://www.himodel.com/FPV_Telemetry/FPV_5.8G_32CH_Auto-scan_A_V_Receiver_RX_RC32S_32CH_Edition.html FPV 5.8G 32CH Auto-scan A/V Receiver (RX) RC32S]

The performance of the receivder did not match my expectations, so I deceidet to modify it.

First I remove all unused part to get full access to the rx module and the space for the Adruino.
Check the next image how clean it became:

In the next step I had to look for all the required pads for my modificatons.

[http://www.watterott.com/de/Wattuino-pro-mini-5V-16MH The Wattuino pro mini adv 5V/16MHz] was my choice to fit perfect in the case.

Here you see all the wired cables:

Than I place the Arduino, I use an gyro tape

The Adiuno got so "gyro tape" to stay in its place.

After that the wiring got finished.

*NOTE*: The modification of the internal receiver module did not work, so I replaced it by a new rx5808 with.
