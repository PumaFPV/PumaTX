#summary Overview of used technology

= 5.8 GHz Channels =

In the RC modeler scene a 5.8GHz uncompressed video link is standard.

The 5.8GHz band has up to 32 different channels that can be used.

The channel is selected depending of the used equipment and location (law restictions).

Here is a list of valid channels:

||  Band  || CH 1 || CH 2 || CH 3 || CH 4 || CH 5 || CH 6 || CH 7 || CH 8 ||
|| Band A || 5865 || 5845 || 5825 || 5805 || 5785 || 5765 || 5745 || 5725 ||
|| Band B || 5733 || 5752 || 5771 || 5790 || 5809 || 5828 || 5847 || 5866 ||
|| Band E || 5705 || 5685 || 5665 || 5645 || 5885 || 5905 || 5925 || 5945 ||
|| Band F || 5740 || 5760 || 5780 || 5800 || 5820 || 5840 || 5860 || 5880 ||

== Special Notes ==

All the bands are overlapping. Than means not all 32 channels can be used at once.
In practise 4-6 channles may run together.

Beside that the channel number are sometime not coralating the freqency.
Check the Band E (step from CH4 -> CH 5) and decending oder (Band A).
