## Radio Receivers

This board does not support Parallel PWM receiver connection. Only SerialRX, PPM and MSP receivers are supported.

SerialRX and PPM receivers should be connected to dedicated _PPM SBUS_ connector above _Motor 1_. MSP receivers should be connected to one of UARTs configured as MSP.

## Motors

| Motor     | pin   |
| ----      | ----  |
| 1         | PB0   |
| 2         | PB1   |
| 3         | PA3   |
| 4         | PA2   |
| 5         | PA1   |
| 6         | PA8   |

## USB

This board uses STM32 VCP and _not_ utilizes UART when USB is connected. STM32 VCP drivers might be required!

Flashing requires DFU mode and STM32 DFU drivers. Two options for installing the proper driver:

* [Zadig](http://zadig.akeo.ie) tool to install WinUSB driver on Windows.
* [ImpulseRC Driver Fixer](https://impulserc.com/pages/downloads) installs the STM32 DFU driver with a single click.

## Buzzer / Beeper

5V piezo buzzer should be connected directly to dedicated pins _BUZ +_ and _BUZ -_. No additional hardware is required.

## RSSI ADC

* Connected to pin PA0
* 3.3V tolerant, do not supply 5V

## Current Meter ADC

* Connected to pin PC1
* 3.3V tolerant, do not supply 5V

## Voltage monitoring

* Connected to pin PC2
* Connected to VBAT pins (both are the same) and integrated Voltage Stabilizer (LM7805M)

## Integrated voltage stabilizer (Omnibus F4 v1 only)

It is integrated with voltage monitoring and always powered when VBAT is connected to battery.
Because this is a **Linear Stabilizer**, it has a tendency to overheat, especially on 4S. Because of that,
avoid powering too many devices directly to 5V pins on the board. RX receiver (and board itself) is rather all
it can do without overeating (150mA on 4S gives 1.5W of waste heat!). OSD, LED Strip and other devices should powered from separate BEC if voltage monitoring is to be enabled.

## LED Strip

LED strip is enabled as indicated on flight controller silkscreen or schematics.
For INAV versions before v1.8.0, LED strip was shared with Motor 5 pin (PA1).
For Omnibus F4 Pro clones (Banggood, AliExpress, eBay, etc.) use **OMNIBUSF4PRO_LEDSTRIPM5** target for LED strip on M5 pin as the dedicated LED strip connection on these devices is typically wired incorrectly.

## SoftwareSerial

### Omnibus F4 v1/v2 SoftwareSerial Connections

This board allows for single **SoftwareSerial** port on small soldering pads located on the bottom side of the board.
Please note that this is *not* the motor PWM5/PWM6 pins, but small surface mount pads CH5/CH6.

### Omnibus F4 Pro SoftwareSerial Connections

| Pad   | SoftwareSerial Role   |
| ----  | ----                  |
| CH5   | RX                    |
| CH6   | TX                    |

![Omnibus F4 Pro SmartPort using SoftwareSerial](assets/images/omnibusf4pro_ss.png)

### Omnibus F4 v3/v4/v5 SoftwareSerial Connections

The SOFTSERIAL1 is an uni-directional port mapped to UART6-TX pin.
When enabled, the UART6 is still available as hardware port but it's then RX-only port (good for e.g. receiving S.BUS input). TX instead is controlled in software and can be used for transmitting one-way telemetry (e.g. LTM). Please note that UART6-TX line passes programmable inverter on those boards, so it is a pure output-only port. SmartPort/FPort telemetry requires bi-directional communication, so it is not possible on this port without hardware modification (bypassing the inverter).
