# Command Line Interface (CLI)

INAV has a command line interface (CLI) that can be used to change settings and configure the FC.

## Accessing the CLI.

The CLI can be accessed via the GUI tool or via a terminal emulator connected to the CLI serial port.

1. Connect your terminal emulator to the CLI serial port (which, by default, is the same as the MSP serial port)
2. Use the baudrate specified by msp_baudrate (115200 by default).
3. Send a `#` character.

To save your settings type in 'save', saving will reboot the flight controller.

To exit the CLI without saving power off the flight controller or type in 'exit'.

To see a list of other commands type in 'help' and press return.

To dump your configuration (including the current profile), use the 'dump' or 'diff' command.

See the other documentation sections for details of the cli commands and settings that are available.

## Backup via CLI

Disconnect main power, connect to cli via USB/FTDI.

dump using cli

```
profile 0
dump
```

dump profiles using cli if you use them

```
profile 1
dump profile
profile 2
dump profile
```

copy screen output to a file and save it.

Alternatively, use the `diff` command to dump only those settings that differ from their default values (those that have been changed).


## Restore via CLI.

Use the cli `defaults` command first.

When restoring from backup it's a good idea to do a dump of the latest defaults so you know what has changed - if you do this each time a firmware release is created you will be able to see the cli changes between firmware versions. If you blindly restore your backup you would not benefit from these new defaults or may even end up with completely wrong settings in case some parameters changed semantics and/or value ranges.

It may be good idea to restore settings using the `diff` output rather than complete `dump`. This way you can have more control on what is restored and the risk of mistakenly restoring bad values if the semantics changes is minimised.

To perform the restore simply paste the saved commands in the Configurator CLI tab and then type `save`.

After restoring it's always a good idea to `dump` or `diff` the settings once again and compare the output with previous one to verify if everything is set as it should be.

## CLI Variable Reference

|  Variable Name | Default Value | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  looptime  | 1000 | This is the main loop time (in us). Changing this affects PID effect with some PID controllers (see PID section for details). A very conservative value of 3500us/285Hz should work for everyone. Setting it to zero does not limit loop time, so it will go as fast as possible. |
|  i2c_speed | 400KHZ | This setting controls the clock speed of I2C bus. 400KHZ is the default that most setups are able to use. Some noise-free setups may be overclocked to 800KHZ. Some sensor chips or setups with long wires may work unreliably at 400KHZ - user can try lowering the clock speed to 200KHZ or even 100KHZ. User need to bear in mind that lower clock speeds might require higher looptimes (lower looptime rate) |
|  cpu_underclock  | OFF | This option is only available on certain architectures (F3 CPUs at the moment). It makes CPU clock lower to reduce interference to long-range RC systems working at 433MHz |
|  gyro_sync  | OFF | This option enables gyro_sync feature. In this case the loop will be synced to gyro refresh rate. Loop will always wait for the newest gyro measurement. Maximum gyro refresh rate is determined by gyro_hardware_lpf  |
|  min_check  | 1100 | These are min/max values (in us) which, when a channel is smaller (min) or larger (max) than the value will activate various RC commands, such as arming, or stick configuration. Normally, every RC channel should be set so that min = 1000us, max = 2000us. On most transmitters this usually means 125% endpoints. Default check values are 100us above/below this value. |
|  max_check  | 1900 | These are min/max values (in us) which, when a channel is smaller (min) or larger (max) than the value will activate various RC commands, such as arming, or stick configuration. Normally, every RC channel should be set so that min = 1000us, max = 2000us. On most transmitters this usually means 125% endpoints. Default check values are 100us above/below this value. |
|  rssi_channel  | 0 | RX channel containing the RSSI signal |
|  rssi_min  | 0 | The minimum RSSI value sent by the receiver, in %. For example, if your receiver's minimum RSSI value shows as 42% in the configurator/OSD set this parameter to 42. See also rssi_max. Note that rssi_min can be set to a value bigger than rssi_max to invert the RSSI calculation (i.e. bigger values mean lower RSSI). |
|  rssi_max  | 100 | The maximum RSSI value sent by the receiver, in %. For example, if your receiver's maximum RSSI value shows as 83% in the configurator/OSD set this parameter to 83. See also rssi_min. |
|  rc_filter_frequency  | 50 | RC data biquad filter cutoff frequency. Lower cutoff frequencies result in smoother response at expense of command control delay. Practical values are 20-50. Set to zero to disable entirely and use unsmoothed RC stick values |
|  input_filtering_mode  | OFF | Filter out noise from OpenLRS Telemetry RX |
|  min_throttle  | 1150 | These are min/max values (in us) that are sent to esc when armed. Defaults of 1150/1850 are OK for everyone, for use with AfroESC, they could be set to 1064/1864. |
|  max_throttle  | 1850 | These are min/max values (in us) that are sent to esc when armed. Defaults of 1150/1850 are OK for everyone, for use with AfroESC, they could be set to 1064/1864. If you have brushed motors, the value should be set to 2000. |
|  min_command  | 1000 | This is the PWM value sent to ESCs when they are not armed. If ESCs beep slowly when powered up, try decreasing this value. It can also be used for calibrating all ESCs at once. |
|  3d_deadband_low  | 1406 | Low value of throttle deadband for 3D mode (when stick is in the 3d_deadband_throttle range, the fixed values of 3d_deadband_low / _high are used instead) |
|  3d_deadband_high  | 1514 | High value of throttle deadband for 3D mode (when stick is in the deadband range, the value in 3d_neutral is used instead) |
|  3d_neutral  | 1460 | Neutral (stop) throttle value for 3D mode |
|  3d_deadband_throttle  | 50 | Throttle signal will be held to a fixed value when throttle is centered with an error margin defined in this parameter. |
|  motor_pwm_rate  | 400 | Output frequency (in Hz) for motor pins. Default is 400Hz for motor with motor_pwm_protocol set to STANDARD. For *SHOT (e.g. ONESHOT125) values of 1000 and 2000 have been tested by the development team and are supported. It may be possible to use higher values. For BRUSHED values of 8000 and above should be used. Setting to 8000 will use brushed mode at 8kHz switching frequency. Up to 32kHz is supported for brushed. Default is 16000 for boards with brushed motors. Note, that in brushed mode, minthrottle is offset to zero. For brushed mode, set max_throttle to 2000. |
|  motor_pwm_protocol  | STANDARD | Protocol that is used to send motor updates to ESCs. Possible values - STANDARD, ONESHOT125, ONESHOT42, MULTISHOT, DSHOT150, DSHOT300, DSHOT600, DSHOT1200, BRUSHED |
|  fixed_wing_auto_arm  | OFF | Auto-arm fixed wing aircraft on throttle above min_throttle, and disarming with stick commands are disabled, so power cycle is required to disarm. Requires enabled motorstop and no arm switch configured. |
|  disarm_kill_switch  | ON | Disarms the motors independently of throttle value. Setting to OFF reverts to the old behaviour of disarming only when the throttle is low. Only applies when arming and disarming with an AUX channel. |
|  auto_disarm_delay  | 5 | Delay before automatic disarming when using stick arming and MOTOR_STOP. This does not apply when using FIXED_WING |
|  switch_disarm_delay | 250 | Delay before disarming when requested by switch (ms) [0-1000] |

|  gps_ublox_use_galileo | OFF | Enable use of Galileo satellites. This is at the expense of other regional constellations, so benefit may also be regional. Requires M8N and Ublox firmware 3.x (or later) [OFF/ON].
|  inav_auto_mag_decl  | ON | Automatic setting of magnetic declination based on GPS position. When used manual magnetic declination is ignored. |
|  inav_gravity_cal_tolerance  | 5 | Unarmed gravity calibration tolerance level. Won't finish the calibration until estimated gravity error falls below this value. |
|  inav_use_gps_velned  | ON | Defined if iNav should use velocity data provided by GPS module for doing position and speed estimation. If set to OFF iNav will fallback to calculating velocity from GPS coordinates. Using native velocity data may improve performance on some GPS modules. Some GPS modules introduce significant delay and using native velocity may actually result in much worse performance. |
|  inav_gps_delay  | 200 | GPS position and velocity data usually arrive with a delay. This parameter defines this delay. Default (200) should be reasonable for most GPS receivers. |
|  inav_reset_altitude | FIRST_ARM | Defines when relative estimated altitude is reset to zero. Variants - `NEVER` (once reference is acquired it's used regardless); `FIRST_ARM` (keep altitude at zero until firstly armed), `EACH_ARM` (altitude is reset to zero on each arming) |
|  inav_reset_home | EACH_ARM | Allows to chose when the home position is reset. Can help prevent resetting home position after accidental mid-air disarm. Possible values are: NEVER, FIRST_ARM and EACH_ARM |

Below this distance, the mode will activate at the current location and the final phase is executed (loiter / land). Above this distance, the full procedure is activated, which may include initial climb and flying directly to the homepoint before entering the loiter / land phase. |
|  nav_overrides_motor_stop | ON | Setting to OFF combined with MOTOR_STOP feature will allow user to stop motor when in autonomous modes. On most places this setting is likely to cause a stall. |
|  nav_rth_climb_first  | ON | If set to ON drone will climb to nav_rth_altitude first and head home afterwards. If set to OFF drone will head home instantly and climb on the way. |

|  serialrx_inverted     | OFF | Reverse the serial inversion of the  serial RX protocol. When this value is OFF, each protocol will use its default signal (e.g. SBUS will use an inverted signal). Some OpenLRS receivers produce a non-inverted SBUS signal. This setting supports this type of receivers (including modified FrSKY). |
|  spektrum_sat_bind  | 0 | 0 = disabled. Used to bind the spektrum satellite to RX |
|  telemetry_switch  | OFF | Which aux channel to use to change serial output & baud rate (MSP / Telemetry). It disables automatic switching to Telemetry when armed. |

|  platform_type        |  "MULTIROTOR"  | Defines UAV platform type. Allowed values: "MULTIROTOR", "AIRPLANE", "HELICOPTER", "TRICOPTER", "ROVER", "BOAT". Currently only MULTIROTOR, AIRPLANE and TRICOPTER types are implemented |
|  has_flaps        |  OFF  | Defines is UAV is capable of having flaps. If ON and AIRPLANE `platform_type` is used, **FLAPERON** flight mode will be available for the pilot  |
|  model_preview_type        |  -1  | ID of mixer preset applied in a Configurator. **Do not modify manually**. Used only for backup/restore reasons.  |
|  tz_offset  | 0 | Time zone offset from UTC, in minutes. This is applied to the GPS time for logging and time-stamping of Blackbox logs |
|  tz_automatic_dst  | OFF | Automatically add Daylight Saving Time to the GPS time when needed or simply ignore it. Includes presets for EU and the USA - if you live outside these areas it is suggested to manage DST manually via `tz_offset`.  |
|  vtx_band  | 4 | Configure the VTX band. Set to zero to use `vtx_freq`. Bands: 1: A, 2: B, 3: E, 4: F, 5: Race. |
|  vtx_channel  | 1 | Channel to use within the configured `vtx_band`. Valid values are [1, 8]. |
|  vtx_freq  | 5740 | Set the VTX frequency using raw MHz. This parameter is ignored unless `vtx_band` is 0. |
|  vtx_halfduplex  | ON | Use half duplex UART to communicate with the VTX, using only a TX pin in the FC. |
|  vtx_low_power_disarm  | OFF | When the craft is disarmed, set the VTX to its lowest power. `ON` will set the power to its minimum value on startup, increase it to `vtx_power` when arming and change it back to its lowest setting after disarming. `UNTIL_FIRST_ARM` will start with minimum power, but once the craft is armed it will increase to `vtx_power` and it will never decrease until the craft is power cycled. |
|  vtx_pit_mode_freq  | Frequency to use (in MHz) when the VTX is in pit mode. |
|  vtx_power  | 1 | VTX RF power level to use. The exact number of mw depends on the VTX hardware. |
