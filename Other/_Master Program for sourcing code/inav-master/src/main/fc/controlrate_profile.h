Max and min available values for rates are now stored as absolute
tenths of degrees-per-second [dsp/10]
That means, max. rotation rate 180 equals 1800dps

New defaults of 200dps for pitch,roll and yaw are more less
equivalent of rates 0 from previous versions of iNav, Cleanflight, Baseflight
and so on.
