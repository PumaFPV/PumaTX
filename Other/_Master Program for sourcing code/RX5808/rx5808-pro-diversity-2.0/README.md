[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.png)](https://gitter.im/rx5808-pro-diversity/)

This project is a fork of [rx5808-pro](https://code.google.com/p/rx5808-pro/) with support for diversity and much more.

Manufactured version of this project can be found at [La Forge FPV](www.laforgefpv.com)

The code is also backward compatible with the original rx5808-pro schematic minus diversity, dip switch mode and TV_Out. For details on updating click [here](/docs/diy-arduino-nano.md).

1. **Auto Scan** - Scans all bands until a signal with good signal strength is found.
2. **Manual Mode** - Will hold on a manually selected channel.
3. **Band Scanner** - Scans all bands and presents them with a signal strength bar graph.
5. **Settings Menu** - Saves last used channel and mode for next power cycle. This is also where you enter RSSI calibration mode.
    1. **Calibrate RSSI** - Calibrate the min and max RSSI values.


#### Initial Setup
When powering on for the first time it is best to calibrate your RSSI modules. No two modules have the same RSSI min and max readings. To calibrate follow these steps below. You can repeat this process as many times as needed.

1. Go to the settings menu and follow the calibrate RSSI steps on the screen.

# Hardware
#### Manufactured
If you are not looking to build your own hardware you can purchase manufactured versions from the following companies.

1. **[La Forge FPV](http://www.laforgefpv.com/vrx-pro)** - VRX-PRO
  - Designed by Shea Ivey
  - All Current Hardware versions.
2. Realacc - rx5808-pro-diversity
  - All current hardware versions.
3. FuriousFPV - True-D
  - V2.0 and earlier

#### DIY

This project is centered around the RX5808 5.8GHz receiver module which can be found at a number of online stores. The original rx5808-pro schematic has been modified to incorporate the diversity setup. Additional LEDs have also been added to show the active receiver.
