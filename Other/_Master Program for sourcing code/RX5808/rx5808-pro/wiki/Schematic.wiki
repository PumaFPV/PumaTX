#summary Schematic of rx5808-pro

=Schematic=

There are multiple ways to Build your Receiver with that scope of functions that fit´s perfect for your needs.
The software you need is for all the Schematics the same and could be found under "Software"

Possible configurations:

|| *Configuration* || Features ||
|| [#Full_Featured Full Featured] || All functions ||
|| [#4_Button 4 Button]        || Best control including SAVE button ||
|| [#3_Button 3 Button]        || Best control (Save in menue as option) ||
|| [#2_Button 2 Button]        || Minumu control ||
|| [#DIP_only DIP only]        || No video, simple DIP configuration ||



These are just examples how you can set up your own receiver Hardware! If you dont know which version you should take, here a short descripion which thing is necessary for what:

|| The Dip Switches || Manually Change the Channel and Band without using the OSD Menue or any other key ||	
|| The Save Button  || For "Push button" Saving without the Save Function (You can save "blind" without going to OSD and Save function)||
|| The Menu Button  || Mandatory if you want to use the full scope of Functions, Needet to enter Menu ^^ and to select the menue functions ||
|| Up Button || Mandatory for restart seek, manual up, restart scan ||
|| Down Button || Optional down button, uses ONLY for manual control ||
|| The Buzzer || Optional for Audio Feedback of button operation, Finishing the Autoscan etc. ||
|| The RSSI Signal || Mandatory for the Autoscan and Spektrumanalyzer function (Gives the Strength of the received Signal to the Arduino) ||


==Full Featured==

If you want to use all Functions, you have to wire it up like in this schematic:

If You want the premium version with 4 Buttons but you doesn´t need the DIP Switches, take that schematic:

==3 Button==

If you want to modify your cheap Boscam 32Ch Autoscan (which is no real autoscan... search the web!) Receiver and just have 3 Buttons and not so much space,
follow this schematic:

==2 Button==


If you want to build it the easiest way, follow this schematic (Yes with this Version you can Use the FULL SCOPE OF FUNCTIONS Except the Channel switching with the DIP´s):

==DIP only==

If you just want a cheap 32Ch Receiver with frequency setup via DIP Switches, follow this schematic (in this version you *can NOT* use the Autoscan or the Spektrumanalyzer!):
