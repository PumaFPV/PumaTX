The following guidelines should be followed as much as possible when writing code for this project:
1)  Code should be in 'C' whenever possible
2)  Exported function names should be named as <module>_<function> (i.e. SPIFlash_Init() )
3)  Indentation should be 4 spaces
4)  Code should compile without warnings even with -Wall

Hardware specific functions are defined in target/<target>.  The goal will be to standardize the
interface as much as possibe so that the same core code can be used for multiple transmitters.
Whether this is actually a feasible goal remains to be seen.

Screen interface functions are defined in screen/<screen>.  Each screen represents support for
a specific screen resolution (i.e. qvga = 320x240)
