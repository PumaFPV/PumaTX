# This is a very crude tool that will convert a picture of a font character
# (or a row of several characters that are fixed space apart)
# and convert it into an xpm-line representation
#
# This script will only work well with highly maginfied images.  It was tested with
# images where each pixel of thefont character was ~13x13 pixels in the image
# Also, it has no auto-detection.  Spacing between pixels and between characters must be
# Specified below
# NOTE: the output is not actually XPM, but easily converted as needed
#       see xpm_to_bdf.pl and bdf_to_font.pl
