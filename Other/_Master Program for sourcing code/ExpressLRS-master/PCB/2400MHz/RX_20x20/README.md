## Features

* 20x20 footprint
* 0805 size SMD components (for easy soldering) - NOTE: LED is still 0603 as this size is more common in LEDs
* Components are placed for ease of soldering (easy iron access)
* u.fl antenna connector footprint for 2.4 GHz antenna
* PCB trace antenna for WiFi
* 5V input (when using the reg), or 3.3V input (bypasses the reg pads) if your FC supplies a decent 3.3V output

## Editing

* The PCB has been developed in Eagle, and the custom libraries that were used are attached in the /lib directory. Copy the project files into you Eagle project dir, and the libs into your lib dir, then fire up Eagle and edit.

## Ordering

* I've had good results using JLCPCB (<https://jlcpcb.com/>). Upload the .zip file in this repo and adjust any PCB parameters that you want (defaults work fine).
* A super-lightweight build can be achieved by going to a 0.6mm PCB thickness (without an increase to cost)'

## Build

* Build should be self-explanatory given PCB labeling + Schematic diagram.
* **[BOM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T2mhwylJRkJdaq0IyqfzjkTpoj9uZ8fdSAFEOPCxJ9Y/edit#gid=1826098941)**(passives not included)
