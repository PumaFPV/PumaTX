## Bill of materials
If this is the option you are following, then you must have a pretty good idea of what you are doing.   Check the BOM for the DIY PCB version of the hardware as a starting point.  You can find the link [here](Module_Build_yourself_PCB.md).

The Arduino Pro-Mini is available many places online.  Check Sparkfun (the original developers of the Pro-Mini) page [here](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11113)

A module case that fits your receiver like the one [here](https://www.xtremepowersystems.net/proddetail.php?prod=XPS-J1CASE)

  or you can 3D print your own from a selection on Thingiverse ([Example 1](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1852868) [Example 2](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1661833)).

  For 9XR/9XR Pro, a new 3D printed module is available which makes use of the built in antenna in the handle. This means nothing is getting out of the radio back. You can find all details of this module case on [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2050717).
