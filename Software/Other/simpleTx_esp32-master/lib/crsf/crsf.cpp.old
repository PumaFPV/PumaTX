 =======================================================================================================
 * CRSF protocol
 *
 * CRSF protocol uses a single wire half duplex uart connection.
 * The master sends one frame every 4ms and the slave replies between two frames from the master.
 *
 * 420000 baud
 * not inverted
 * 8 Bit
 * 1 Stop bit
 * Big endian
 * ELRS uses crossfire protocol at many different baud rates supported by EdgeTX i.e. 115k, 400k, 921k, 1.87M, 3.75M
 * 115000 bit/s = 14400 byte/s
 * 420000 bit/s = 46667 byte/s (including stop bit) = 21.43us per byte
 * Max frame size is 64 bytes
 * A 64 byte frame plus 1 sync byte can be transmitted in 1393 microseconds.
 *
 * CRSF_TIME_NEEDED_PER_FRAME_US is set conservatively at 1500 microseconds
 *
 * Every frame has the structure:
 * <Device address><Frame length><Type><Payload><CRC>
 *
 * Device address: (uint8_t)
 * Frame length:   length in  bytes including Type (uint8_t)
 * Type:           (uint8_t)
 * CRC:            (uint8_t)
